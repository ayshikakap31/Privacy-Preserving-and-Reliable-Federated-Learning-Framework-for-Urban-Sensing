# An end-to-end privacy preserving framework for user privacy, model reliability, and fair incentivization for federated learning based urban sensing system

This work validates the proposed framework for urban parameter modeling, leveraging synthetic data generated with the NoiseModelling GIS Tool. The tool incorporates building, land use, transportation network, and traffic information to produce environmental noise models. In this simulation, a 1km Ã— 1.5km region in Lorient, north-western France, is chosen, utilizing the EPSG:2154 spatial reference system. Dynamic noise measurements are simulated over ten days, resulting in 30 parameter models. The project focuses on creating high granularity parameter models by interpolating measurements at probe stations using the IDW spatial interpolation technique.

The work uses the dataset file 'parameter_data.npz'.
